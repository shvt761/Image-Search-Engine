1. In order to generate secret key (API access) from Unsplash, we create an account in that very website.
2. Then we process a demo app for the access of the photos through React Application.
3. We enter the secret key to the side of the Client-ID in our program.
4. We save the app.js file.
5. We run the NPM.
6. Then, we're done applying the API to our program.
7. Check the Output.png file for the output of the coded program respectively.
